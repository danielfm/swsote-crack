= Star Wars: Shadows Of The Empire Crack

This is a code I wrote a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away :-) when
studying a little bit of assembly and reverse engineering techniques. So,
don't mind the ugly code!

This app is a little Windows-based application that patches the game
executable in order to bypass CD-ROM check. It was developed in
Visual C++ 6 and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) library.
